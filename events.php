				<h2>Future Events</h2>
				<p>Ignite is a great chance for people to get up in front of an enthusiastic audience and present their ideas! Some people give their first presentation ever at Ignite, others have presented at 100s of conferences before, but never in their home town.</p>
				<p>The plan is to continue organizing Ignite Ithaca events for as long as people are interested in speaking and attending. We'll try to fit in with the acadmic year of both Cornell and Ithaca College and to have two events per year: One in spring and one in fall. If you have questions about future events, please write us at info@igniteithaca.com.</p>			
			
				<h2>Ignite Ithaca<sup>2</sup>, November 2010</h2>
				<p>Ignite Ithaca<sup>2</sup> on November 6, 2010, was the second time we were running an Ignite event in Ithaca. We kept the best parts of our first event like <strong>the venue</strong>, the <strong>20-slides-in-5-minutes format</strong>, and the <strong>mix of topics</strong> from techy to local interest and everything in between while improving on some of the details.</p>
				
				<p>We are still busy compiling the complete details about all presenters and are working on editing the videos. If you wrote a blog post about the event or have photos, please share them with us!</p>
				
				<p>You will shortly be able to watch all presentation from Ignite Ithaca<sup>2</sup> <a href="/videos.php">on our Videos site</a>.</p>
				
				<h2>Ignite Ithaca<sup>1</sup>, November 2010</h2>
				<p>Ithaca saw it's first Ignite event on April 14, 2010, in Pixel Lounge in Ithaca. It seems like Ithaca likes Ignite, the room was packed for the entire evening!<br /> <img src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0z7wyuNoe1qbntg8o1_500.jpg" alt="Photo taken at the start of Ignite Ithaca 1 on April 14, 2010" /></p>
